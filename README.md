This is a school project that connects STM32 on Discovery Board with QT UI.  
It is based on accelerometer and gyroscope that track orientation of board. Then it uses this value to move game board.  
Because game is 2D there is implemented light change that make illusion of changing orientation of board.  
Code was made in hurry but maybe it will help someone.
## UI looks like this
